CTF CHALLANGE SOLUTION 


1.Native Cipher
   
   The given encoding is to be cipher encoded and hence using online ceaser cipher encoder the encoded sting was     
    decoded and got the flag.Here ascii value of d + 5 gives i. By taking 5 as the key the flag is obtained. 

2. Single byte XOR

    The given encoded string is xor ed with ‘z’ by using the following python code.
   
         
enc=bytes.fromhex('1314190e1c1001024a0825194e145d0e251849251f4e091316032518084a11491407').decode('utf-8')
f= ""
for i in range (len(enc)):
    f+=chr(ord(enc[i])^ord('z'))
print(f)

And hence the flag is obtained.


3. base-base-base

    The given string inside the txt file was first converted using base64 decoder and hence hence obtained a similar string   
    which is similar to the given string was obtained. Then using base32 converted to hex and this hex is then converted    
    to a string and the flag is obtained.


4. Multiple encoder

     There are two files given, a txt and a python program, while going through the python file we can observe that the txt 
     file is obatined when a string “x” was runned in the python program. So reversing the action will give us the “x” and 
     hence the sting in txt was first decoded to a string and now this string is decoded with base64 online converter. This 
     process is repeated 5 times as 5 is mentioned in the python program and hence we find the flag which is the “x” file.

5. Con-the-Cat

    The given file is a png file, and hence on extracting it using foremost command we can obtain a file that contain 4 jpg  
    files and these one png file. Among the 4 jpg files one is the flag.

6. Snow Man
 
    As it is mentioned in the name of the challange “snow”, using stegsnow encryption tool on the file flag.txt with the 
    password “thisiseasy” which we obtained from the file flag.txt. We get an base64 string and this is decoded using 
    base64 decoder and finaly we obtain the flag.

7. Mischief Kid
 
    The given file is a zip file and this file is extracted and a new file is obtained which contains a jpg file and this jpg file   
    is extracted using foremost command and we get a zip file inside that, extract it will give two files a flag.txt and  
    busted.png. Opening busted.png in ghex ,there is an error in the hex code of the png file, using instert the code was 
    corrected and saved, now when we open busted.png file the flag is obtained. 

8. Angry Steve

    Only a .jpg file is given, usings strings Angry.jpg command we get the hidden flag in it.
